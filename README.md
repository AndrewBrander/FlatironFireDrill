#Flatiron Fire Drill
#####Initial version

Currently assigns each student to an integer, then prints a randomized layout of the room.

I encourage students to fork this program and make any changes they feel like!
Seriously, anything. Change how the layout prints to the terminal,
create a new algorithm to improve the sorting process, or even add some comments to improve
the readability and maintainability of this program.


######Desired features:
1. Just put student names in the seats and remove the int mapping. This requires more complex formatting, because names have variable lengths.
2. Make it so that no table can have more than 1 empty seat (reshuffle if any quadrant has more than 1 empty)
